File Descrptions:

	1. mainF.py --- to be run for training and testing FCNN
	2. convNN.py --- to be run for training and testing CNN
	3. layers.py --- contains classes used in making the FCNN
	4. loadDataForCifar.py --- to be run to obtain relevant training and testing data from the CIFAR dataset (see following steps)
	
STEPS before running the files:
	1.Run the loadDataForCifar.py file in the folder where the CIFAR 10 dataset has been extracted.
	2.This would generate 10 output files. Move them to the folder where mainF.py (FCNN code) and convNN.py (CNN code) are located and then run the two codes.
